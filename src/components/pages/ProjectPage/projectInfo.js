      'The Omnidirectional VR Treadmill is a treadmill that has a connected virtual reality (VR) set, which gives users the experience of moving around in a fictional or foreign place. This design was inspired by the Holodeck from Star Trek and was one of the first projects of the UTOPH team.',

    description:
      "The 3D Room Scanner is a handheld device that can be used to easily scan a room and get details about it, such as its size and shape, which can be used to develop virtual reality (VR) landscapes. By sweeping the device's scanner across the room, it can identify the corners and dimensions to create a 3D mapping which can be used as a framework for VR projects. This model primarily uses Lidar, a 360 degree camera, and a HTC Vive controller, which keeps track of the device's position.",

    description:
      'The Leap Motion VR Interaction is a tool that uses a sensor to map the motion of the userâ€™s hands to a digital 3D skeleton without needing to attach any external devices. Currently it is able to track simple motions with relative accuracy; our goal for this project is to integrate multiple sensors in order to improve the precision and recognise more complex gestures and motions.',
